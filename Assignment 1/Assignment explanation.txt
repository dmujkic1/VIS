1st year Probability and Statistics project where I had the role of team leader and motivator. The goal was
to use Python scripts to present a certain dataset of our choice. We had to use the topics covered in our
lectures like analytics through basic diagrams such as Scatter plots, Box plots and Histogram plots. We also
had to design our project around questions which we predicted would be asked about our chosen dataset.
The Bayes theorem was applied, as well as covariances and correlations.
