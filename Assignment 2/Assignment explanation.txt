Another 1st year Probability and Statistics Python project where we had to choose a new dataset from the
Kaggle website, which had at least four numeric variables and three to four categorical variables. After
that, analysis of the dataset was to be done using descriptive statistics and visualizations of variable
distributions. Chi-square tests for independence were used as well, along with Kolmogorov-Smirnov and
Shapiro-Wilk statistic tests, QQ plots as a test for normality, confidence intervals and confidence intervals
for proportions, among others.
